## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno/Nano)
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Jumper wires & breadboard
- 3D printed housing (`Assembly 1.stl`)
- Power supply (USB or battery)

### Setup Instructions
1. Print the 3D housing using the provided `.stl` file.  
2. Assemble the parts using the **Assembly Drawing**.  
3. Connect components as per the circuit diagram (`Circuit for soil detector.png`).  
4. Upload the Arduino code (`swanky_uusam_lappi1.ino`) to your board.  
5. Power up the system and insert the soil sensor into the soil.
